## Description

- This project involved adding functionality to pre-existing code.
- Using JQUERY, several functions have been added:

    - Data from this form modal is used to create a 'taskCard'.
    - 'taskCard' data is then pushed to 'localStorage'.
    - Task cards are then rendered to the page as draggable containers.
    - Background color for the cards is set based on time left until task due date.
    - Task cards can be removed with a 'deleteTask' button on the individual cards
